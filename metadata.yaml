description: "Mr. Justice Raffles was a 1909 novel written by E.W. Hornung. It featured\
  \ his popular character A. J. Raffles a well-known cricketer and gentleman thief.\
  \ It was the fourth and last in his four Raffles books which had begun with The\
  \ Amateur Cracksman in 1899.\nUnlike the three previous works, the book was a full-length\
  \ novel and featured darker elements than the earlier collections of short stories.\
  \ In it a jaded Raffles is growing increasingly cynical about British high society.\
  \ He encounters Dan Levy, an unscrupulous moneylender, who manages to entrap a number\
  \ of young men, mostly sons of the wealthy, by giving them loans and then charging\
  \ huge amounts of interest. Raffles takes it upon himself to teach Levy a lesson.\n\
  At the end of Hornung's second Raffles short story collection The Black Mask, Raffles\
  \ and his companion Bunny Manders volunteer for service in the Second Boer War in\
  \ 1899 where he was killed at the hands of the Boers. Hornung had intended this\
  \ as a patriotic finale to his hero's story. However there was great popular demand\
  \ for the return of the character, and a number of generous publishing offers, and\
  \ Hornung agreed to write another book.\nIn this he has been compared to Arthur\
  \ Conan Doyle's decision to resurrect Sherlock Holmes after he had been killed falling\
  \ over the Reichenbach Falls. Doyle had managed this by revealing that Holmes had\
  \ actually survived the falls, while Hornung set Mr. Justice Raffles before the\
  \ events of the Boer War. The comparison between the resurrections of Holmes and\
  \ Raffles is made interesting by the fact that Doyle and Hornung were brothers-in-law.\
  \ Indeed prior to resurrecting Holmes, Doyle had used much the same technique, demand\
  \ had called for another Holmes story, so the book he wrote to meet this demand\
  \ The Hound of the Baskervilles was set prior to Holmes's \"demise\".\nIts reception\
  \ was mixed, with some fans lamenting the loss of the carefree gentlemen thief of\
  \ the early stories. It was the last Raffles work written by Hornung, although a\
  \ number of continuations have been written by other authors in a mixture of parody\
  \ and homage.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
